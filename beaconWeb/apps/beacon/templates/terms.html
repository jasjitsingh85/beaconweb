		<h1>Hotspot is a service that helps you meet up with your friends in real life. Hotspot is a free service.</h1>

		<h1>TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>

		<h2>The following terms and conditions govern all use of the Hotspot service (collectively the "Service"). The Service is offered subject to your acceptance without modification of all of the terms and conditions contained herein.</h2>

		<h1>AGREEMENT TO BE BOUND</h1>

		<h2>Please read the Terms carefully before accessing or using the Service. By accessing or using any part of the Service, you agree to be bound by the Terms. If you do not agree to the Terms, then you may not access or use the Service. Hotspot may amend the Terms from time to time and will provide notice of any substantive changes on this website. Continued usage of the Service constitutes acceptance of the amended Terms.</h2>

		<h1>ABILITY TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT</h1>

		<h2>The Service is available only to individuals who are at least 13 years old. By using the Service you represent that you are at least 13 years of age and otherwise able to enter into a valid and binding legal agreement and acknowledge that the Terms constitute a valid, binding agreement between you and us.</h2>

		<h1>Hotspot SERVICE</h1>

		<h2>The Service enables you invite friends, coworkers, and other individuals to impromptu events via a text message that describes the event including its time and place. Hotspot will only invite those you specificy via text. Through the mobile app, you may also see "Hotspot" posted by friends (whose phone numbers you have) to which you were not specifically invited.</h2>


		<h1>TEXT MESSAGING FEES</h1>

		<h2>Hotspot does not charge a fee to use the Service, but any text messages sent and/or received are subject to standard text messaging rates. Additionally, text messages sent and/or received count towards a monthly quota as any other messages do. Any users, whether sending or receiving text messages with Hotspot, should be aware that standard text messaging rates may apply. Please be aware that texting charges can fluctuate internationally. Text messaging rates can normally be found by asking your provider.</h2>

		<h1>SMS USAGE POLICY</h1>

		<h2>This SMS Use Policy is designed to prevent fraud and abuse of our subscriptions by a small number of users.</h2>

		<h2>Hotspot is primarily intended for use with our downloadable application. The ability to send and receive SMS messages is only an additive benefit. SMS usage is limited and any usage over 100 messages per month may lead to restricted use of SMS, required use of the downloadable application and possibly termination of Hotspot' SMS capabilities. To maintain uninterrupted messaging, it is recommended that you download the Hotspot application for messaging.</h2>

		<h1>Hotspot ACCOUNTS AND USE OF SERVICE</h1>

		<h2>If you create an account on Hotspot, you are responsible for maintaining the security of your account, and you are fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and any other actions taken in connection with your groups. You must immediately notify us of any unauthorized uses of your group, your account, or any other breaches of security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by any user, including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions. Further, you agree that you will provide only truthful information in your user profile and will neither falsify your phone number or your email address nor spoof another individual's phone number or email address.</h2>

		<h2>Any Content transmitted by groups is not representative of our opinions. Links may be transmitted, none of which are endorsed by or affiliated with us. Please use your discretion in following these links and utilizing the Service and keep in mind that all use is governed by the Terms.</h2>

		<h1>CONTENT LICENSING</h1>

		<h2>By using Hotspot and submitting Content to a group, you grant us a world-wide, royalty-free, perpetual, fully sub-licenseable and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish the Content in connection with the Service.

This may include modifying or stopping the Service in its entirety.</h2>


		<h1>MODIFICATIONS TO AND TERMINATION OF THE SERVICE</h1>

		<h2>Hotspot may periodically make updates to the Service. Disruptions to the Service are rare but may occur. Hotspot reserves the right to terminate the Service at its sole discretion. This may prevent you from accessing any Content made available through or on the Service.</h2>

		<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

		<h2>Messages transmitted via Hotspot are subject to the Hotspot Privacy Policy, available online at http://getHotspot.com/privacy</h2>

		<h1>TERMINATION OF ACCESS TO CONTENT AND SERVICE</h1>

		<h1>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h1>

		<h2>YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE AND SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. THE SOFTWARE AND SERVICE ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. Hotspot AND ITS AFFILIATES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. Hotspot DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS, OR USEFULNESS OF THE SERVICE, AND YOU RELY ON THE SERVICE AT YOUR OWN RISK. ANY MATERIAL TRANSMITTED OR STORED THROUGH USE OF THE SERVICE IS DONE AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION AND RISK AND YOU WILL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE OR LOSS OF DATA THAT RESULTS FROM THE TRANSMISSION OF ANY MATERIAL THROUGH THE SERVICE. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU FROM Hotspot OR THROUGH OR FROM THE SERVICE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT. SOME STATES MAY PROHIBIT A DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES AND YOU MAY HAVE OTHER RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM STATE TO STATE.</h2>

		<h1>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h1>

		<h2>NEITHER Hotspot NOR OUR AFFILIATES, LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF Hotspot HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THESE DAMAGES), RESULTING FROM YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICE. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL Hotspot'S OR OUR AFFILIATES', LICENSORS' OR SUPPLIERS' TOTAL LIABILITY OF ALL KINDS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTY CLAIMS), REGARDLESS OF THE FORUM AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY ACTION OR CLAIM IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE GREATER OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY YOU TO Hotspot FOR THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICE OR $50. THE LIMITATIONS SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. BECAUSE SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION ON CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</h2>

		<h1>INDEMNIFICATION</h1>

		<h2>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Hotspot, its contractors, affiliates and its licensors, and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from and against any and all claims and expenses, including attorneys' fees, arising out of your use of the Software and/or Service, including but not limited to your violation of the Terms, or your breach of any representation or warranty contained in these Terms.</h2>

		<h1>FORCE MAJEURE</h1>

		<h2>We will not be liable to you for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under the Terms if the delay or failure is due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control.</h2>

		<h1>MISCELLANEOUS</h1>

		<h2>These Terms constitute the entire agreement between Hotspot and you concerning the subject matter hereof, and may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized executive of Hotspot, or by the posting by Hotspot of a revised version. You agree that any notice, agreements, disclosure, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing or otherwise be authorized. There are no third party beneficiaries to the Terms. Our failure to act in a particular circumstance does not waive our ability to act with respect to that circumstance or similar circumstances. If any provision of the Terms is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms remain in full force and effect.</h2>
